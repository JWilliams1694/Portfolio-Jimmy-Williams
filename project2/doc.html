    <p>website can return any pokemon you search up to Gen 8, and any amount of pokemon after that in order, you can also filter by type.</p>
    <p>Api can only search for one at a time, so I needed multiple search and data loaded functions.</p>
    <p>searched for pokemon, saved id, and ran the search again for id+1 until max pokemon was hit.</p>
    <p>for filter, still have to search one by one, and only print ones that apply because of api limitations</p>

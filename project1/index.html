                    <p> As he sails the vast seas, he adds new members to his gang of Straw Hat Pirates. Destination:
                        The
                        Grand Line! After all his adventures and battles against famous foes, he's a big-shot rookie
                        with a
                        3 billion berry bounty on his head! </p>

                    <p>Luffy is a big eater who loves to feast. While his freewheeling nature may be vexing to some, he
                        believes in himself and his trusted friends above all else!</p>

                        talent, he serves the same role for the Straw Hats. Versed in lying and bluffing, he's prone to
                        boasting, but this can help him in a fight. Deft of
                        hand, Usopp is talented in crafting new tools and weapons. He was in charge of ship repairs
                        until Franky joined.</p>
                    <p>Usopp has a pessimistic, cowardly personality. Dangerous adventures and powerful foes often get
                        the better of him, but he summons all his courage to stand up once more and continue on the path
                        of a true warrior of the sea!</p>

                        She came to hate pirates after a certain crew took over her hometown, but after Luffy saved her,
                        she joined the Straw Hats.</p>
                    <p>Nami is arguably the most level-headed of the crew. Not only does she set the ship's course,
                        she's the team mom who looks after the others. She's also very strict with money, and anyone who
                        overspends in her presence will soon regret it.</p>
